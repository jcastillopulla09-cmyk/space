          Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world to harbor life. 
          About 71% of its surface is covered by water, with vast oceans, lush forests, and diverse ecosystems that sustain millions of species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its atmosphere, rich in oxygen and nitrogen, protects life by blocking harmful solar radiation and moderating the planet’s temperature. 
          Earth rotates once every 24 hours and travels around the Sun in 365 days, giving us day, night, and the changing seasons.
